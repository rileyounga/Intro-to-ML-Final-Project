This repository is a copy of the final project repository from my Introduction to Machine Learning Course. `final_project_OptionA_answers.pdf` contains the answers and explainations to the tasks described in `ista421ML-f2023-final-project-OptionA-MCMC.pdf`. The project task was building a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC python implementation to infer parameters of a 3D line based on projections of that line onto 2D space through one or two camera models.
